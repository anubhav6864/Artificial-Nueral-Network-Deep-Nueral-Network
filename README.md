# Artificial-Nueral-Network-Deep-Nueral-Network
In this every single step of Training a Deep Nueral Network is included.

1. Introduction to Nueral Network includes the basic step by step bulding of nueral network with help of Tf.learn library and the plain tensorflow, on the very famous MNIST dataset:-
Topics covered are:-

Perceptrons.

Activation functions.

Using straight of the art Tf.learn.

Plain Tensorflow for gaining more control over optimizations which includes following steps:-

Construction phase

Defining placeholders

Defining the loss function

Defining the gradient descent optimizer

Specifying how to evaluate the model

Initialize variables and create saver

Define the number of epochs

and Train the model


2. In Training Deep Neural Network I have used all the necessary optimisation techniques , with different types of activation function incuding all the following:-

Vanishing/Exploding Gradients Problem

Dealing with the above problem using weight Initializing technique.

He Initialization

Nonsaturating Activation Functions

Leaky ReLU

ELU

SELU

Batch Normalization

Gradient Clipping

Reusing Pretrained Layers

Reusing a TensorFlow Model

Reusing only part of the original model

Faster Optimizers

Momentum optimization

Nesterov Accelerated Gradient

AdaGrad

RMSProp

Adam Optimization

Learning Rate Scheduling

Avoiding Overfitting Through Regularization

ℓ1  and ℓ2 regularization

Dropout

Max norm
