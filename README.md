In this every single step of Training a Deep Nueral Network is included.

1. Introduction to Nueral Network includes the basic step by step bulding of nueral network with help of Tf.learn library and the plain tensorflow, on the very famous MNIST dataset.

2. In Training Deep Neural Network i have used all the necessary optimisation techniques , with different types of activation function.
